We've stood on the shoulders of countless giants in working on this project. Below is a non-exhaustive list of the many previous efforts that we drew heavily from (let us know who we've missed and we'll make sure to add them):

## Sapflow
- Burgess, S.S.O., Adams, M.A., Turner, N.C., Beverly, C.R., Ong, C.K., Khan, A.A.H., and Bleby, T.M. (2001). An improved heat pulse method to measure low and reverse rates of sap flow in woody plants. Tree Physiology 21, 589–598. 
- Clearwater, M.J., Luo, Z., Mazzeo, M., and Dichio, B. (2009). An external heat pulse method for measurement of sap flow through fruit pedicels, leaf petioles and other small-diameter stems. Plant, Cell & Environment 32, 1652–1663.
- Marshall, D.C. (1958). Measurement of Sap Flow in Conifers by Heat Transport. Plant Physiol. 33, 385–396.
